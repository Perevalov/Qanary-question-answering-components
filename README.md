# Qanary Components Integrated in Frankenstein

We decoupled the Frankenstein architecture and presented reusable resources as an extension to the Qanary. Frankenstein is dedicated to extending
the Qanary ecosystem by the following contributions:
#R1
It contributes a large set of new components to the ecosystem of reusable components initiated by the Qanary. Consequently, researchers and practitioners are now enabled to create a large set of different QA systems outof-
the-box due to the composability features inherited from the Qanary. We calculated that only by using the components directly provided by Frankenstein/ Qanary 380 different ready-to-use QA pipelines can be created with small invest on time.

#Qanary
Qanary is a methodology for creating Question Answering Systems it is part of the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.eu) where question answering systems are researched and developed. For all the publications related to Qanary please see the section [publications](#qanarypublications). W.r.t. questions, ideas or any feedback related to Qanary please do not hesitate to [contact the core developers](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki/Who-do-I-talk-to%3F). However, if you like to see a QA system built using the Qanary framework, one of our core developers has build a complete end-to-end QA system which allows to query several RDF data stores: http://wdaqua.eu/qa.

Please go to the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki) of this repository to get more insights on how to use this framework, how to add new component etc.
